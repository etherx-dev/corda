     * This class sets up network message handlers for requests from peers for data keyed by hash. It is a piece of simple
     * glue that sits between the network layer and the database layer.
     *
     * Note that in our data model, to be able to name a thing by hash automatically gives the power to request it. There
     * are no access control lists. If you want to keep some data private, then you must be careful who you give its name
     * to, and trust that they will not pass the name onwards. If someone suspects some data might exist but does not have
     * its name, then the 256-bit search space they'd have to cover makes it physically impossible to enumerate, and as
     * such the hash of a piece of data can be seen as a type of password allowing access to it.
     *
     * Additionally, because nodes do not store invalid transactions, requesting such a transaction will always yield null.
