/**
 * A sub-class of [ProtocolLogic<T>] implements a protocol flow using direct, straight line blocking code. Thus you
 * can write complex protocol logic in an ordinary fashion, without having to think about callbacks, restarting after
 * a node crash, how many instances of your protocol there are running and so on.
 *
 * Invoking the network will cause the call stack to be suspended onto the heap and then serialized to a database using
 * the Quasar fibers framework. Because of this, if you need access to data that might change over time, you should
 * request it just-in-time via the [serviceHub] property which is provided. Don't try and keep data you got from a
 * service across calls to send/receive/sendAndReceive because the world might change in arbitrary ways out from
 * underneath you, for instance, if the node is restarted or reconfigured!
 *
 * Additionally, be aware of what data you pin either via the stack or in your [ProtocolLogic] implementation. Very large
 * objects or datasets will hurt performance by increasing the amount of data stored in each checkpoint.
 *
 * If you'd like to use another ProtocolLogic class as a component of your own, construct it on the fly and then pass
 * it to the [subProtocol] method. It will return the result of that protocol when it completes.
